# Module 7 Challenge - Work Day/Daily Scheduler

## Description

This respositorty contains the code for a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and Moment.JS. Using what I had learned in class and self-study I was able to create an application that fulfil these requirements:

```md
- Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.

- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

- Persist events between refreshes of a page
```

## Thoughts and Improvements

Future changes that I think could really improve this scheduler:

```md
- Update the appearance of the scheduler itself.

- Use a more modern date utility library like Luxon or Day.js.

- Option to load either the next and previous day's tasks .

- Ability to clear all current tasks from the input boxes when the day is over.
```
